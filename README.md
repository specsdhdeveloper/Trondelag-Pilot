It was started with some boilerplate for standing up an Angular app that implements the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.  We leverage the Angular CLI and the [esri-loader](https://github.com/Esri/esri-loader). Check the [wiki](https://github.com/specsdhdeveloper/Trondelag-Pilot/wiki) for some information on the map integration
